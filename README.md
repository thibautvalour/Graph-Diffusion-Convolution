# Graph-Diffusion-Convolution

This repository contains the implementation of the research paper, "Diffusion Improves Graph Learning" by Johannes Gasteiger, Stefan Weißenberger, and Stephan Günnemann. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05485.

## Overview
The Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) technique presented in this paper demonstrates how incorporating diffusion processes can enhance graph learning. By leveraging graph diffusion, GDC can effectively extract and utilize higher-order information from graph structures, leading to improved performance in a variety of graph-based machine learning tasks.

In this repository, you will find the code for our reimplementation of the GDC, along with a summary of the research paper in the `Report.pdf` file.
